# BMI-Calculator
This was my first JS project attempted on my own. As an overview, it is a simple app that calculates the user's BMI using the values of their weight and height to determine whether they are underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese.

#HTML and CSS
As a general rule of thumb, I like to seperate my HTML with comments so both I and the person viewing my code can understand the flow of the document and what is actually going on. For the CSS, I used the SCSS preprocessor to seperate different sections of my styling to keep the code neat and organized.

#Javascript
With my Javascript, I initialized the variables that I wasgoing to be using throughout the project as well as the functions that would hold my calculations and conversions. I added some color styling via JS conditions to the result of the user
s BMI that refers to a color chart at the top of the calculator. The colors are assigned to the titles of "underweight" (purple), "healthy" (green), "overweight" (yellow), and "obese" (red).
